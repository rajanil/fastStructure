Binary PED files
To save space and time, you can make a binary ped file (*.bed). This will store the pedigree/phenotype
information in separate file (*.fam) and create an extended MAP file (*.bim) (which contains information
about the allele names, which would otherwise be lost in the BED file).
 
plink.bed      ( binary file, genotype information )
plink.fam      ( first six columns of mydata.ped ) 
plink.bim      ( extended MAP file: two extra cols = allele names)

bed = binary ped
fam = pedigree information from ped (plain text)
bim = map file

###################
ped file:
The PED file is a white-space (space or tab) delimited file: the first six columns are mandatory:
     Family ID
     Individual ID
     Paternal ID
     Maternal ID
     Sex (1=male; 2=female; other=unknown)
     Phenotype

Genotypes (column 7 onwards) should also be white-space delimited;
they can be any character (e.g. 1,2,3,4 or A,C,G,T or anything else)
except 0 which is, by default, the missing genotype character. All
markers should be biallelic. All SNPs (whether haploid or not) must
have two alleles specified. Either Both alleles should be missing
(i.e. 0) or neither. No header row should be given. For example, here
are two individuals typed for 3 SNPs (one row = one person):

     FAM001  1  0 0  1  2  A A  G G  A C 
     FAM001  2  0 0  1  2  A A  A G  0 0 

###################
map file:
By default, each line of the MAP file describes a single marker
and must contain exactly 4 columns:
     chromosome (1-22, X, Y or 0 if unplaced)
     rs# or snp identifier
     Genetic distance (morgans)
     Base-pair position (bp units)
