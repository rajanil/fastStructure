Reading map (extended format) from [ test/testdata.bim ] 
500 markers to be included from [ test/testdata.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ test/testdata.fam ] 
200 individuals read from [ test/testdata.fam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 200 missing
200 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ test/testdata.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 500 SNPs
1 founders and 199 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 500 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 200 missing
After filtering, 200 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
